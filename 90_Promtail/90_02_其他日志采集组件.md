除了使用Promtail，社区还有很多采集日志的组件，比如fluentd、fluent bit等，都是比较优秀的。

Loki supports the following official clients for sending logs:

- [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/)
- [Docker Driver](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/docker-driver/)
- [Fluentd](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/fluentd/)
- [Fluent Bit](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/fluentbit/)
- [Logstash](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/logstash/)
- [Lambda Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/lambda-promtail/)


**Promtail**
Promtail is the client of choice when you’re running Kubernetes, as you can configure it to automatically scrape logs from pods running on the same node that Promtail runs on. Promtail and Prometheus running together in Kubernetes enables powerful debugging: if Prometheus and Promtail use the same labels, users can use tools like Grafana to switch between metrics and logs based on the label set.

Promtail is also the client of choice on bare-metal since it can be configured to tail logs from all files given a host path. It is the easiest way to send logs to Loki from plain-text files (e.g., things that log to `/var/log/*.log`).

Lastly, Promtail works well if you want to extract metrics from logs such as counting the occurrences of a particular message.



**Docker Logging Driver**
When using Docker and not Kubernetes, the Docker logging driver for Loki should be used as it automatically adds labels appropriate to the running container.


**Fluentd and Fluent Bit**
The Fluentd and Fluent Bit plugins are ideal when you already have Fluentd deployed and you already have configured `Parser` and `Filter` plugins.
Fluentd also works well for extracting metrics from logs when using its Prometheus plugin.



**Logstash**
If you are already using logstash and/or beats, this will be the easiest way to start. By adding our output plugin you can quickly try Loki without doing big configuration changes.
